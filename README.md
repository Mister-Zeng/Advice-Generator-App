## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- API

### What I learned

This was my first project I created that use an API. This project taught me how to fetch, store, delete data with local storage.

### Continued development

In the future, I want to improve my restFUL API knowledge and built a full CRUD app.
